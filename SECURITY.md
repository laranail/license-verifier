# Security Policy

## Supported versions

Security fixes are provided for the latest released minor version of
`laranail/license-verifier`. Please keep your installation up to date.

## Reporting a vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, **please do not open a public
issue**. Instead, email **opensource@simtabi.com** with:

- a description of the vulnerability and its impact,
- steps to reproduce (proof of concept if possible),
- the affected version(s).

You will receive an acknowledgement within a few business days. We will work
with you to validate the issue, prepare a fix, and coordinate a disclosure
timeline. Please give us a reasonable window to release a fix before any public
disclosure.

## Scope note

This package verifies licenses; it is a client-side trust component. Offline
verification relies on the configured public key / token signatures — keep your
license server's signing keys secret, rotate them per `docs/security.md`, and
treat a leaked private signing key as a critical incident on the **server**
(`laranail/license-kit`) side.
